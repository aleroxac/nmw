          Hi John, good to have you here, today we gonna talk a little bit about career, hobbies, etc, ok?
      john: |
        Hello Rosemary, looks nice! 
      rosemary: |
        I would like to tell my story, it's was started a long time ago, when i'm 16 years old and i have my first
        technology job.

        I worked as programmer, actually i helped my uncle with small PERL scripts. Obviously he had to check
        everything, he just gave me the "job" to introduce me to the area and make me enjoy it. 
        I was making about $25 a week. They were relatively small scripts, but there were a lot of them,
        some were firewall regex scripts, following OWASP rules.

        I have learned html, css and javascript, passed some time, i'm more confortable with programming and then
        i make my first business, a website when a sell my tumblr themes. After it, school, university and then my
        first formal job. 

        Forget all history about programming, my fist job was on support. On support i made a ton of scripts until
        my leader ask me if i want to stop work on support and be the responsible for all automation scripts on
        company, obviously i accepted.

        I have worked on software house, where once for all, i could do what i really like. I worked as frontend
        developer by 2 years, and then i ventured as full stack developer using ruby, rails and jasvascript stack.

        From ruby i'm go to java, my live turn into a hell, to much legacy apps to support. This lasted 5 years.
        With almost 10 years of career, as a senior developer, I started investing in tech lead and tech manager
        vacancies, I evolved, learning to deal more with people and processes, less code, 
        until I reached a management position.

        More 10 years passed, and too much friends and networking made, i have started to participate of events,
        i did a MBA, and this is my first opportunity as CO-CEO.

        I'm glad to stay here because this is the step i wanted in my career and with my technichal background
        i feel i can understund and help all areas, mainly tech, its my favorite, of course.
        
        Now, i'll talk a little bit about myself, no boring stuff about career rsrsrsrs
        I'm 42 years old, i have 2 daugthers and 1 son, the daughters have 20 and 16 years old, and the boy has 12.
        
        I love to travel and try new restaurants, new cultures, from burguer to high gastronomy, from a single beach
        to awarded hotels and resorts and america countries, like Brazil, of corse, i love São Paulo, 
        it's not like that stuff, to many shoots rsrsrsrs

        Thats all, i said too much, you must be tired of listening to me. Now it's your turn, tell us a little about
        yourself, your story, what you like to do, etc.        
      john:
        That's awesome history, are you a dev since child, so good. Ok, now its my turn rsrsrs
        
        I'll start unlike you, talking about me, and then my career.
        I'm 28 year old, i'm live with my parents. We live in Barueri, a city of São Paulo state west zone.
        I love watch movies and tv series, like Game of Thrones, Vikings and Peaky Blinders...yes, a little bit brutal
        i know. I'm not a travel guy, but recently we start to visit some restaurants, we have some places to visit,
        planning to travel to the northeast of the country. My parents dont get out frequently, and i inherit
        this curse, but now we are getting better, going out a little more, it's been so good.

        How could you notice, i'm a homebody, nerd, a lover of technology, a good guy who always got screwed, and now
        he's getting better, putting things in order. In general, I'm at that stage in life where we try to balance
        our careers with our social lives.

        Now, lets go to career.
        I started as you, as support technician. The the contract of company where i worked was expired and then IBM
        earned and call me and a lot of people of my team to work with them. Challange accepted.

        At IBM has a culture of pick-load and regular, where you turn regular only after 2 years, until then you cannot
        change of area or get raises and promotions, owfull, but the reality. I stayed there for 2 years and 8 months, 
        I was fired due to cost reduction issues

        As here on Brazil who has a company cannot receive unemployment insurance, i was left without it, because at
        that time my father needed my name to open his company together with a partner.

        Time to study like a crazy man. Three or four month after, i get my firt job on devops area.
        Since support technician, i was studying linux too much, even my colleagues make fun of me.
        At the time I wanted to be a dev, but somehow I had to have Linux in the mix.

        On Pagseguro, my firt devops job, I had my first experience logging into a Linux server, managing,
        monitoring, etc.
        Just like you, I started creating some scripts, automating some processes, But my leaders didn't pay attention
        to my efforts, so I started to get discouraged.
        
        I took my vacation, continued studying shell scripting, Linux, Ansible, Terraform, etc. In the last week of
        the holidays I started a selection process for a devops vacancy, I was a trainee and the vacancy was for
        full-time employees, I would skip 1 step. I accepted the challenge, took the tests and passed, and asked for
        the bills the same week I returned from vacation. I'm still a little sad because they just said goodbye,
        they didn't even want to know why I was sick, they didn't try to make me stay, super human treatment, but no.

        After that i started on a place where i think i have a my biggest evolution, as a person, career,
        financially, challenges, experiences.
